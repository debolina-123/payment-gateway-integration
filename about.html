                        <p>'Together We Fight' has been in India since 1951. It is a movement of people working to end 
                        discrimination and create a just and an equal India. In 2019 alone, 22,621 children (53% of 
                        which are girls) from our intervention area were enrolled in schools and are receiving quality
                         education. We were also successful in making 400 schools functional in terms of infrastructure,
                          quality education and mid-day meals.

                        Your monthly donation will help us continue demanding good quality public education and regulation 
                         private schools so that every child in India gets the education they deserve. Monthly donations help 
                          to work on the ground without any hurdles.</p>
